\section{ Conclusions:}
 \vspace{5mm}
 Based on my research, the most liked food in katanga is mulokoni and the restaurants that have mulokoni on their menu are fairing really well in terms of average customers received per day.
Also to note that the welfare of most restaurants is well based on minimum wage given to employees which can enable them atleast attain their basic needs.
Lastly most restaurants around katanga need to improve on their cleaniliness.
